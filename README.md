How to interact trello using whatsapp messages?

Yes, we can do that.

This Web app demostrates how to interact with trello using whatsapp messages.

To accomplish we need:

1. Registred Whatsapp Bussiness Number.
2. A webhook which reacts on whatsapp messages.
3. Trello's official API key and token.
4. A web app which with utilize trellos API and eventually by which we can perform different operations in trello.

------------------------------VERSION 1------------------------------
I have just implemented a web-app, using Django-Framework, by which I can accomplish following tasks:
		1. Send a message, in a particular pattern, from whatsapp. Message contains "CREATE BOARD COMMAND" and "BOARD NAME". Eg. @createboard-Home_Cores
		2. Django web-app can read that message and accordingly perfrom operation in trello, which creates a board with the provided "BOARD NAME", in our example it is "Home_Chores"



------------------------------VERSION 2------------------------------
Working on it my adding more operations in this Web-app. Would be happy if anyone wants to work togather.
